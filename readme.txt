Promote Us
How to promote the above to business owners seeking to conduct more business overseas.
Wechat
Include publishing / push feeds under other 3rd party accounts (paid)
If service is offered, can create the mini-programs
Xiaohongshu
Consider different identifiers (summarized info collected by Wechat is available for each wechat account)

What we need to do to standout in the campaign
Content – capped to 30 seconds; one main message
Find suitable timing for push (e.g. Thursday)
Article has an “advantage” for informational contents – quick and easy; video is more for entertainment
Good to have “anime images” in the article for a better visualizing impact
Hashtag is a must

Effort required 
Weekly post
More intense postings in the beginning then smooth out on a rolling basis over the duration of campaign
Wechat: 
If using 3rd party accounts – distribute posts through several relevant 3rd party accounts, cascading the publication over the planned  campaign
Xiaohongshu: more flexible depending on our needs and schedule
Duration of campaign: start with 2 to 3 months

Estimated Budget required
(From past experience) using 3rd party account to publish one article may perhaps be around RMB 7 – 8K, including content writing by the 3rd party – us only need to provide key points
Maybe cheaper if in higher frequency
Advertising companies may be able to connect and utilize several different accounts ( fee may be cheaper through them?)
At least RMB 50,000 – 100,000 over period of several months

Promote Clients overseas
Profiling – create a marketable profile
Industry 
Addressable Market
Targeted Buyers
Technical aspects
History

Methods
Short term: Seeking 2 – 3 selling point if product
Long term committed clients would be focused more on branding and story telling
Using social media Assume client is more B2B oriented:
X (brand message and frequent update)
Amazon (ordering samples, gain visibility)
IG – minimum a profile page
Facebook – minimum a profile page
LinkedIn – minimum a profile page
Other media
Press release (prefer at an “industry cluster”)
Direct Email – more effective at later stage of a campaign or mature marketing cycle
Event
Tradeshow

What we need to do to stand out in the campaign
Press releases announce company’s entry – use publishing PR company would be best
For social media channels – more about story telling – mix of traditional style written articles and KOL created contents



Effort required
Campaign – could have more intense blast in the first half of campaign, then using a slower rollout alternating over different channels
Several months at least

ROI: 
If more awareness -> turn to concrete sales: This allows to build a more sustained product lifecycle, with better chance to have “upgraded” versions instead of having to spend more quickly on churning new products – save on cost, build recognition
Brand value building (intangible)


Budget
At list USD 50,000 over a campaign period over several months
